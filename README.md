"No matter where you go, everyone's connected."  -Lain Iwakura

I would like to learn and eventually contribute to the technical futures of interconnected nodes.

I will use this repository to learn how to code. Hopefully I will build skills and find interesting and positive communities where I may grow and participate in. 

Just what I am seeking is not clear yet.

I have learned that I do not fully align with US Law and its practices. 

Now healthcare has lost its grip with me. I see less focus on science, data, healthcare, wellbeing; Healthcare is centered on stress and is built with an inherently sickening lifestyle.

So what do I value? 

Data, consequence, care, decentralization, unique applications.

Lifestyle changes are what I need to personally make. 
Green living, ecological thoughtfulness, universal help, and art are important and I don't know how to bring these things together (maybe they should be kept seperate).

Regardless, I am one person, made of many ideas. I am alive, only because of love, so what else am I to do?
